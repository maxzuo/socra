# [Socra](https://socra-400c0.firebaseapp.com)
A great way to facilitate socratic seminars, teacher-friendly and student-friendly.

### How it works
Socra allows teachers to take a step back during class discussions or meetings, choosing the next speaker automatically by picking the student or speaker who wishes to speak and also has the least amount of time spoken, evenly distributing the amount of time people get to speak.

Teachers using Socra can not only see how many times their students have spoken and how long they have spoken for, but also the number of times they have raised their hands.

### In Future Updates
Future updates will bring exciting new features!!!

⋅⋅* Students and teachers will be able to make their accounts and log in to keep their preferences and classes saved.
⋅⋅* Teachers will be able to create their own discussions (Current version requires teachers to contact admin).
